\begin{When}
\itemwhen
  \Fix \(X\) : closed \(\text{Spin}^c\) manifold \\
  \Fix \(Y\) : submanifold \(\subset X\) dual to the determinant bundle of \(X\)
\itemprop
  \Then \(Y\) carries a canonical Spin structure
\end{When}

\begin{Theorem}[main result (theorem 3)]
\itemprop
  \AIMAI{express \(KO\)-characteristic numbers of \(Y\) in terms of the \(K\)-numbers of \(X\)}
\itemnote
  \AIMAI{when \(\text{dim} Y\) is not a multiple of \(4\) and the topological Riemann-Roch theorem , this is useful}
\end{Theorem}
